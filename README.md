## Diffusion Model Learning
Here I will add some of my own notes, insights and demos about learning the diffusion model.

### docs
In the docs folder, I have my notes on diffusion model, including papers and good blogs, ODE review, some derivation of SDE in diffusion model, and a series of understanding of diffusion model code. However, since the pdf exported by `yuque` is really unforgiving, there may be a lot of typographical problems. However, I have opened access to the connection at: [yuque link](https://www.yuque.com/u29155493/ru454g), password is `vghi`.

### demo
In the demo folder, a series of sample demos exists related to dpm solver/dpm solver++. Detail can be found in [readme.md](./demo/README.md).

### model
