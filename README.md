## Diffusion Model Learning
Here I will add some of my own notes, insights and demos about learning the diffusion model.
### docs
In the docs folder, I have my notes on diffusion model, including papers and good blogs, ODE review, some derivation of SDE in diffusion model, and a series of understanding of diffusion model code. However, since the pdf exported by `yuque` is really unforgiving, there may be a lot of typographical problems. However, I have opened access to the connection at: [yuque link](https://www.yuque.com/u29155493/ru454g), password is `vghi`.
### demo
In the demo folder, only dpm solver is currently sampled in the uncond and classifier-guidance scenario, which will be updated later. Detail can be found in [readme.md](./demo/README.md).
