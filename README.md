# Diffusion Model Learning
Here I will add some of my own notes, insights and demos about learning the diffusion model.

## Docs
In the docs folder, I have my notes on diffusion model, including papers and good blogs, ODE review, some derivation of SDE in diffusion model, and a series of understanding of diffusion model code. However, since the pdf exported by `yuque` is really unforgiving, there may be a lot of typographical problems. However, I have opened access to the connection at: [yuque link](https://www.yuque.com/u29155493/ru454g), password is `vghi`.

## Papers
Papers are list in [papers/readme.md](./papers//README.md).

## Demo
In the demo folder, a series of sample demos exists related to dpm solver/dpm solver++. Detail can be found in [demo/readme.md](./demo/README.md).

## Model
UNet copy from [ADM](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion).

## Schedule
Scheduler copy from [DPM Solver/DPM Solver++](https://github.com/LuChengTHU/dpm-solver)
